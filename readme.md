# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Don-Vincent Snell

I have decided to take this class to expand my skill set.  I've worked with clients in designing websites from a visual stand point and gained an understanding of the underlying technologies of the internet and world wide web in the process.  However I never really did any of the coding work and hope to pick up that tool in this class.

But what exactly is the internet?

* I've always liked the "The Web is like the Ocean" metaphor and have relied on it heavily when explaining it to friends and family.  Especially the Dark Web.
* It still surprises me that people think the internet is some ephemeral thing in the air.
* I really dig the fact that our modern web looks and operates so different from when I first trundled onto it in 1993, but the core technologies are the same as they have been since 1969 (for the internet) and 1989 (for the web).
