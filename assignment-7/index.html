          <p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:<br />
          It wearies me; you say it wearies you;<br />
          But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br />
          What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,<br />
          I am to learn;<br />
          And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<br />
          That I have much ado to know myself.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>SALARINO</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="direction">
          <p>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br />
          There, where your argosies with portly sail,<br />
          Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br />
          Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,<br />
          Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br />
          That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br />
          As they fly by them with their woven wings.</p>

        <div class="direction">
          <p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br />
          The better part of my affections would<br />
          Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br />
          Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,<br />
          Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;<br />
          And every object that might make me fear<br />
          Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br />
          Would make me sad.</p>

        <div class="staging">
          <h4>SALARINO</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="direction">
          <p>My wind cooling my broth<br />
          Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br />
          What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<br />
          I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br />
          But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br />
          And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,<br />
          Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs<br />
          To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br />
          And see the holy edifice of stone,<br />
          And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br />
          Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,<br />
          Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br />
          Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br />
          And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br />
          And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br />
          To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br />
          That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br />
          But tell not me; I know, Antonio<br />
          Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>

          <p>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,<br />
          My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br />
          Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br />
          Upon the fortune of this present year:<br />
          Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>
