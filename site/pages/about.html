     <p class="text-center"><b>Howdy!  My name is Don-Vincent Snell and I've been a digital artist for 12 years.</b></p>
     I started with the creation of Iterative Flame Fractals before expanding into 3D modeling, animation, and video work.  I have performed many duties as an artist, from video editing and web design to hardware consultation.  I also dabble in game design and game writing as well as the occasional fiction piece.
     <p>I really enjoy playing games of all varieties and design content for various tabletop RPGs.  Movies and their casual analysis is also a fun hobby.  I also have a fascination with technology and space.  I used to be a Library Director and have been a freelance artist for about 9 years.  If you'd like to hire me or know more about me, don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
     <p class="text-center">Thanks for visiting my site and I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
