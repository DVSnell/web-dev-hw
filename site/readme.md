# Extra Credit Site Readme
* This is a basic gallery/portfolio site for potential employers to look at.  I hope anyone looking at it can see that I am an artist with a number of different skillsets and a broad work experience and education.  I plan on taking this site forward and fine-tuning it into an actual portfolio site since this class has given me the confidence to keep working on web-dev.
