# Extra Credit Site Readme
* This is a basic gallery/portfolio site for potential employers to look at.  I hope anyone looking at it can see that I am an artist with a number of different skillsets and a broad work experience and education.  Since I already had the splash page, I set about using it as a template. I plan on taking this site forward and fine-tuning it into an actual portfolio site since this class has given me the confidence to keep working on web-dev.  ~~I'm still looking for a good image viewer to be embeddable on the page, as UM Box is only halfway there, but it's a kicking off point for a bigger dive into web-dev.~~  Google slides workaround since all the old standbys went a little too corporate, which is ironic in its own right.
