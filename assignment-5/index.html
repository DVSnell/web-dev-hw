      <h3>Lyrics</h3>
      <p>I've been downhearted baby<br />
        I've been down-<br />
        I've been downhearted baby<br />
        Ever since the day we met<br />
        Ever since the day we met<br />
        [x2]</p>

      <p>Jan lays down and wrestles in her sleep<br />
        Moonlight spills on comic books<br />
        And superstars in magazines<br />
        An old friend calls and tells us where to meet<br />
        Her plane takes off from Baltimore<br />
        And touches down on Bourbon Street</p>

      <p>We sit outside and argue all night long<br />
        About a god we've never seen<br />
        But never fails to side with me<br />
        Sunday comes and all the papers say<br />
        Ma Teresa's joined the mob<br />
        And happy with her full time job</p>

      <p>I've been downhearted baby<br />
        I've been down-<br />
        I've been downhearted baby<br />
        Ever since the day we met<br />
        Ever since the day we met<br />
        [x2]</p>

      <p>Am I alive or thoughts that drift away?<br />
        Does summer come for everyone?<br />
        Can humans do as prophets say?<br />
        And if I die before I learn to speak<br />
        Can money pay for all the days I lived awake<br />
        But half asleep?</p>

      <p>A life is time, they teach you growing up<br />
        The seconds ticking killed us all<br />
        A million years before the fall<br />
        You ride the waves and don't ask where they go<br />
        You swim like lions through the crest<br />
        And bathe yourself in zebra flesh</p>

      <p>I've been downhearted baby<br />
        I've been downhearted baby<br />
        Ever since the day we met</p>

      <p>I've been downhearted baby<br />
        I've been down-<br />
        I've been downhearted baby<br />
        Ever since the day we met<br />
        Ever since the day we met<br />
        [x7]</p>
